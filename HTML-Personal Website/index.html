  <h1>Jeffrey Loh</h1>
  <p><em>Product Manager for Saas Services & Products with cross-industry experiences</em></p>
  <p>This is a short bio about me: Hi Team, I’m Jeffrey, but most people call me Jeff.
    I was raised and born in Bremen with roots in Malaysia & Vietnam.
    However, I do not speak Vietnamese or Malayan, but (among others) Chinese-Cantonese….
    to make the confusion perfect.<br>I did my Bachelors in Business Administration and
    after some time added a Masters in Operations/ Technology Management.
    In between I worked as Product Manager in different industries and company sizes and
    am now curious to dive into the tax/compliance world.<br>In my free time,
    I like playing squash, go for a run and as almost every boy in their childhood used to
    play football, but haven’t picked it up for a long time, so definitely currently watch
    more football than actually playing (BTW: Yes, Werder Bremen is the real deal!)
    Besides of that I’m always curious to learn about new stuff and try out new cuisines,
    so feel free to hit me up with any (non-fiction) book recommendations & recipes.
    Recently also started to brew my own beer with a friend…so any pro tips are
    highly welcomed. <br>Happy to connect & feel free to reach out! </p>
